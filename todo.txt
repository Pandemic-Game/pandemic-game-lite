To-do:
- Pilot with three conditions (science, social, control)

Linda points
- infographics are a bit confusing
- intro should be replaced with graphic tutorial
- science info shoudl be more similar to social, in that it is varied, similar in number and presented as social tweets
- preferences wil not be clicked on. could rework into a true social media feed where half the info is hidden behidn a scroll down button
- could encorpoate static infographics into social and science feeds
