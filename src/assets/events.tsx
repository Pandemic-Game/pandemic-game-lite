                The split reaction here is intended to model sunk cost fallacy. Loosely based on the roughly half of the USA 
                who supported former President Trump and his no-lockdown approach to the pandemic. Arguably this is because
                that they had invested in him so they were more likely to hold steadfast in their views. There is some evidence that 
                the public in other countries would similarly defend the status-quo on COVID-19 policies, for example UK respondents 
                agreed that most people were not obeying lockdown (YouGov) but did not agree that it should be enforced (source linked).
